So far I have created a created a react app. 
 
After reading the brief, the main concern is the website being too old, and has old appeal to it.
The stock management system dosent work correctly. 
No mobile version of website/app.
Returns are coming cos people donâ€™t like style/color; because they cant see it in just 1 picture so we need more.
People asking about Delivery times.
 
For presentation I will talk about what is bad currently and how we can improve it. 
Also talk about how to upskill the staff members on agile.
 
For code I will make some pages and show some of these functionalities.
 
Pages that I will create: 
 
Home page (make it look like footlocker)
-	Navigation bar
-	Photos
-	Logo
-	Banners
-	Social media logos
 
1 item page (Nike shoe)
-	Multiple pics
-	Price
-	Description
-	Stock Amount
 
Functionality That I will add:
-	Stock management?
-	User authentication (gives the business data on users (future deals and discounts))
-	Desktop/Mobile compatibility?
-	Estimated delivery times / Tracking shipment?
