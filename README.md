# AND Digital: Golden Shoe interview problem

This project is done to solve the challenge given within an interview by AND Digital, for graduate developer role. 

This is part of a second interview.

The aim of the project is to showcase a better version of a website to increase revenue, and demo some working example of how it would work daily. 

The stack which I have decided to use for this website is:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  - React 

I have decided to use React for this project as it is fast, scalable, and simple. 
As I am new to JavaScript, I have researched and found that React is a great library which can help make life simple, as well as work off the MVC architecture.
